                    <h7>The Lakers are known for having some of the greatest players in NBA history. They have players that changed the NBA and had a huge impact on
                        players on the court and fans off the court. Some Hall of Famers are Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Elgin Baylor, Wilt Chamberlain, Adrian Dantley, 
                        Gail Goodrich, Magic Johnson, Clyde Lovellette, Karl Malone, James Worthy, George Mikan, Jim Pollard, and many more. The Los Angeles Lakers 
                        are, in my opinion, the best team of all time because of what they players did on the court and the impact they had on the league.<h7>
