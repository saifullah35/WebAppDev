                    <h7> The Lakers current roster is very experienced, but they also have a couple young players that are pretty good as well. The young players consist of
                        Talen Horton Tucker, Austin Reaves, Anthony Davis, Stanley Johnson, Kendrick Nunn, and Malik Monk. The veteran players consist of LeBron James, 
                        Dwight Howard, Carmelo Anthony, Rajon Rondo, and Wayne Ellington. This team has struggled this year because of injuries and chemistry, so they have yet
                        to play together which is why they are having issues. However, with the leadership of Lebron James, Anthony Davis, and Carmelo Anthony, hopefully they
                        will make the playoffs and try to win their 18th championship.<h7>
